# 0x09. Island Perimeter
Algorithm Python

## Overview

This project solves the Island Perimeter Problem using a grid-based algorithm. The goal is to calculate the total perimeter of an island represented in a 2D grid, where:

1 = Land
0 = Water
Each land cell contributes to the perimeter based on its exposed edges (adjacent to water or the grid boundary).
